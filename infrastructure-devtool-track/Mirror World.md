## Project Description 

Mirror World’s All-in-One Smart Platform maximizes Web3 revenue conversion through a combination of Shopify-like marketplace solution, on-ramp aggregators, authentication solutions and Fiat-to-NFT solutions.
Studios no longer have to pile up integrations with multiple SaaS solutions and can launch assets to gaming users with their own marketplace, liquidity is aggregated through direct advertisement channel partnerships and Mirror World’s conversion engine.
