## Project Description 

Umi Aggregator is a DEX scaling layer that combines multiple DEX pools to create a large liquidity pool, searches for optimal trade paths, and delivers tokens at the best exchange rate, built on top of Sui.

### Motivation

For users, finding the best exchange rate among various DEXs can be a cumbersome and time-consuming process. They have to manually search for each DEX, compare the rates, and then make a decision. This is where Umi Aggregator comes in as a solution to this problem.

### How we solve

We discover the most optimal price at a given point by collecting on-chain data and using graph search algorithms. Additionally, we provide APIs and SDKs, in addition to a web UI, to make it easy for other projects to integrate Umi Aggregator into their products.

### Use cases
- Coin trading for individual traders
- Spot market payments for DAO and DeFi protocols
- Crypto payment for payment businesses
