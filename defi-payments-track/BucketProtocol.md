## Project Description

Bucket Protocol is a non-custodial, 0% interest lending protocol native to Sui Network.
It charges users an issuance fee to take out an interest-free loan in USD stablecoin (BUCK) backed by SUI or other collateral. Loans can be liquidated if they fall below 110% collateral ratio. Liquidations are supported by a "Emergency Tank" of deposited BUCK used to pay back the loan in exchange for excess SUI.

### Key benefits of Bucket Protocol?

1. 0% interest rate — as a borrower, there’s no need to worry about constantly accruing debt
2. Minimum collateral ratio of 110% — more efficient usage of deposited Sui
3. Directly redeemable — BUCK can be redeemed at face value for the underlying collateral at any time
