## Project Description
### Introduction
ABEx represents a remarkable on-chain derivatives protocol within the Sui ecosystem, leveraging LP-provided liquidity to achieve unparalleled zero-slippage trading. Ingeniously incorporating dynamic funding rates to mitigate protocol risks and attract arbitrage investments, it simultaneously offers an innovative built-in leveraged mining feature, amplifying capital efficiency and delivering outstanding risk-tiered services for LPs.

### Features
- Up to 50x leverage
- Zero-slippage trading
- Higher capital efficiency

### Advantages
- A Coin-Margined settlement mechanism that supports multiple currencies as collateral for futures. For example, using BTC to open a long position on ETH, hedging against ETH's rise relative to BTC. It also supports futures of real assets such as gold, oil, stocks, etc.
- By implementing the dynamic funding rate, the protocol can encourage balance between long and short positions, incentivizing arbitrage and coordinating the overall risk of ALP and the protocol. This helps to ensure a healthy and stable market.
- Use Beta+ to significantly improve the capital efficiency of LP and maximize LP returns within a reasonable range, and help LP providers to classify risk.
