## Project Description

### What is Kriya?

Kriya is a DeFi project focused on building sophisticated infra for trading derivatives on-chain. The core problems we aim to solve via our products are:

- Capital Inefficiency
- Inaccurate Price Discovery
- Fragmented Liquidity
- Disproportionate Custodian Risk

![alt text](../assets/kriya_dex_ss.png)

Weâ€™ve built 2 products so far:

- **KriyaDEX** is an orderbook based DEX for trading perpetuals with 20x leverage and minimal latency (**achieved TPS ~100 on devnet, [package](https://suiscan.xyz/devnet/object/0xd8182f2f10e0163b780026149d89e5cd134327d4) in top 10 by #txns**)
- **KriyaSwap** is an AMM for spot trading (**Used by 10k wallets on devnet**)

<br/>

### Our Vision

<aside>
ðŸ’ª Our vision is simple yet very focused : Be as good as BitMex/Binance but on-chain

</aside>

- Grossly improve DeFi Derivatives UX, multiple order types, multiple product types
- Aggregate liquidity : Orderbook LPing just like AMMs, Basis Yield Vaults
- Integrate with UNIDEX-like perp aggregators in-app to bring cross-chain liquidity
- Release options DEX if the market permits (on the same OB or a single-writer auction infra)
- See if our OB tech is good enough to be outsourced across Sui protocols (could be Sui SERUM) / Make it faster with ZK proofs somehow
- Using perp and options DEX as backend, build advisory vaults (mostly not for retail but DAO treasuries, concentration risk with own token is an open problem)
- Cross-chain margin account (like a superior gearbox)
