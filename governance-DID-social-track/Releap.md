Releap - Decentralized social network for the next billion users on Sui

Creator-owned content: Creators retain ownership and control over their own work and profile, and how it is shared and distributed on the network

Built-in monetization: Creators on Releap can restrict access to content based on membership, one-off payment or other conditions

Censorship resistant: No central point of control that can be targeted by a government or other entity seeking to censor or manipulate content on the platform
